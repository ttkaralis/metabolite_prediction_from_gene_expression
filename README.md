# **Introduction**

Metabolomics provides a direct functional readout of tumour physiology, but currently lags behind other omics technologies in enabling disease monitoring and prognostication. This gap reflects both the scarcity of large-scale metabolomic datasets and the analytical challenges of detecting diverse metabolites with widely varying physicochemical properties and abundancies. To address this, we developed Metabofon, a machine learning framework that predicts metabolomic profiles from gene expression data across multiple cancer types, and implemented it as a user-friendly web platform accessible at https://software.icr.ac.uk/app/metabofon. Using this approach, we inferred the metabolic landscape of human tumours in the context of distinct oncogenic alterations. Leveraging these predictions, we uncovered and experimentally validated de novo pyrimidine synthesis as a selective metabolic vulnerability in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. Overall, this work presents a scalable and efficient pipeline for inferring metabolomic profiles from transcriptomic signatures, enabling reconstruction of tumour metabolic landscapes in samples lacking direct metabolomic measurements and facilitating the discovery of novel metabolic targets for cancer therapy.


# **General information**
This project presents a machine learning framework that predicts metabolomics from gene expression data.
 
All the cell line and tissue pre-trained models along with the scripts can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/ using the accession number _**10.5281/zenodo.18347966**_ .

## **Model training**

Initially, we tested different traditional machine learning models for their ability to predict metabolomics from gene expression data. We trained cell line and tissue specific models:

We also tested different deep learning architectures to predict metabolomics in tissues:

## **Model validation**

The best models were selected and validated with independent tissue and cell line gene expression and metabolomic data:

And subsequently we combined the best model from the traditional machine learning approach with the best deep learning model:

## **Pipeline**

Using the pre-trained models from this repository it is easy to predict metabolomics straight from gene expression (RNA-Seq or microarrays):

# **User guidance**

In the "Script_for_the_user" we describe a simple workflow for the prediction of metabolomics from RNA-Sequencing data. A few things to keep in mind:
- The RNA sequencing data must be in the following format: ".csv" file, sample names in rows, gene names in columns.
- The RNA sequencing data must be TPM-normalized.
- The gene features must be named with the stable Ensembl ID format, e.g. ENSG00000121879
- The script is designed to use only human Ensemble IDs. If you want to use data derived from other organisms (i.e. mouse) you have to perform orthology mapping elsewhere.
